# Vegetable-Detection-and-Rotten-Analysis

Overview:
The Fruit and Vegetable Detection with Rotten Part Detection project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for fruit and vegetable detection, coupled with image processing techniques for identifying rotten parts. This solution offers the capability to train and test data for accurate detection and can be seamlessly integrated into frontend and backend codebases to provide a comprehensive interface and web application.

Features:
CNN for Detection: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate detection of fruits and vegetables in images.
Rotten Part Detection: Employs image processing techniques such as Gaussian and Sobel filters to identify rotten parts within detected fruits and vegetables.

Instructions:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the provided Python scripts for training and testing data.
Integrate the scripts and MATLAB file with your frontend and backend codebases.
Utilize the solution to analyze images, detect fruits, vegetables, and rotten parts, and provide a user-friendly interface through a web application.
